#### Meet Josue  
My name is Josué, a Panamanian student currently living in Finland and studying Information Technology.  
I am passionate about learning, creating, and improving myself day by day. Moving to another country has pushed me to grow, explore new opportunities, and discover who I want to become.  

This page is a personal snapshot of my journey — where I come from, what I’ve learned, and the dreams that guide me forward.
