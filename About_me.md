# About Me

I am Josué, a wanderer at heart with a mind always curious, seeking to understand and create. From a young age, discipline has been part of who I am—shaped by sports, by early mornings, and by the lessons my father shared with patience and care. Those moments taught me resilience, focus, and the quiet strength of dedication.

I believe in someone beyond what I can see, a presence that quietly protects and guides, and I carry that trust with me in every step I take. What drives me most is the thought of freedom—not just for myself, but for those I love. The freedom to dream, to build, and to live a life that feels truly ours.

Every challenge I face, every new skill I learn, is part of the journey toward that vision: a life of purpose, connection, and meaningful growth. I strive to leave a mark that reflects not just what I can achieve, but the values and people who inspire me along the way.
