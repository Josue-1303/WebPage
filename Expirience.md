## Expirience 

I have always enjoyed working whenever I have the opportunity, starting back in school. My dedication and good grades earned me the chance to join Optinetwork, a technology company, as an internship, where I met incredible people who taught me a lot, and I gave my best in every task.

After being accepted into Centria University, I knew I needed to work to support my tuition. I began working at Burger Village in the kitchen, while also creating content and updating information on their website. I didn’t stop there—I also contributed at Ravintola Humo, part of the same company, gaining experience in different aspects of operations.

Currently, I have applied for an internship at Centria, where I hope to collaborate with fellow students and professors to implement a chatbot. I am always eager to learn more, take on challenges, and contribute wherever I can.
