#### Centro Bilingüe Vista Alegre — High School in Technology

I grew up near Centro Bilingüe Vista Alegre, a school that was not only my place of learning but also where I met my closest friends and where my passion for technology first began. The school provided me with a strong foundation in technology while also offering opportunities that went beyond the classroom.

Thanks to the school, I had the chance to complete an internship at Optinetwork, a technology company where I worked with the IT team. This experience allowed me to apply my knowledge in a professional environment, collaborate on real projects, and gain a deeper understanding of technology from a practical perspective.

### Centria University of Applied Sciences — Kokkola, Finland
Recognizing that the education system in Panama has its limitations, I aimed higher and decided to apply to a university in one of the countries with the highest education ratings. As soon as I graduated, I made the difficult decision to separate from my family and friends to fully prepare for the future I had always dreamed of.

I applied immediately after graduation, putting in a great deal of effort, and performed well on the admission exam. Driven by hope, I applied for a work permit and moved to Finland even before receiving my results. Once I received them, I felt as though I had already won in life, even though it was only the beginning.

While here, I began working at Burger Village to support my tuition, balancing work and studies. Today, I am pursuing what I love most—my studies in Information Technology—and it has exceeded all my expectations. I truly love every moment of it.
