## Hobbies

My discipline started on the basketball court. Every day, early mornings and hard practices taught me focus, patience, and dedication.

I remember this picture because it was one of the last times I played without pain. A few months from there, I injured my knee and never got back on track
I guess I was too scared to try again.

**But**, I realized I was good at other stuff such as photography

I fell in love with capturing moments and seeing the reactions of people when they look at my photos. I like how my work shows things that not everyone notices, how a simple image can tell a story.  

I also combined this with cooking. I love to cook, and I enjoy taking pictures of what I make. Seeing the colors, textures, and details through my camera turns every dish into its own small piece of art.

For me, both photography and cooking are about creating, sharing, and connecting with people. It's about seeing beauty where others might not, and sharing that vision with the world.
