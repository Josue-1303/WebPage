# Personal Website

This repository contains the source files for my personal website, built using Markdown and deployed through GitHub Pages.  
The purpose of this project is to showcase my background, education, skills, projects, personal journey, and long-term goals.

## Purpose of the Website
The website serves as:

- A personal introduction  
- A showcase of my experiences and interests  
- A place to document my journey in learning, work, and life  
- A space to share my goals, values, and personal growth
